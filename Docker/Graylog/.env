# Generate one by using for example: pwgen -N 1 -s 96
# ATTENTION: This value must be the same on all Graylog nodes in the cluster.
# Changing this value after installation will render all user sessions and encrypted values in the database invalid. (e.g. encrypted access tokens)

# You MUST specify a hash password for the root user (which you only need to initially set up the

# This password cannot be changed using the API or via the web interface. If you need to change it,

# Create one by using for example: echo -n yourpassword | shasum -a 256
# and put the resulting hash value into the following line
# CHANGE THIS! Default username and password is drn
