# DRN-Project
Distributed Reliable .Net project aims to provide somewhat opinionated design and out of the box solutions to enterprise application development. 
Expected result is spending less time on wiring while getting better maintainability and observability.
The project benefits from the best practices, open source solutions and personal production experience.
This project is about managing software complexity, architecting good solutions and a promise to deliver a good software.

## About Task, Time, Security and Quality Management
* Always make a Todo List
* Prioritize tasks - Use your insights or MoSCoW prioritization etc...
* Warm up whenever possible - start with one easy task then focus on hard one.
* Know your options 4D+E - Do it, drop it, delegate it, defer it or escalate.
> 4D comes from David Allen's 4d model. +E is my personal addition to it. Escalation is your friend. Inform others and ask their opinions whenever you are not sure what to do.
* Small things add up then become big thing. Do it while they are small and avoid stress.
* Don't micro manage delegate whenever possible.
* Don't over optimize. Good enough is better than excellent.
* Prefer whitelisting over blacklisting. Blacklists can be penetrated.
* Follow best practices and solutions. Don't reinvent the wheel
* Denormalize when needed. Understand how it works. Don't follow rules blindly. 
  * You can accomplish things that considered not possible if you understanding how things works.
  * Understand concepts and how they relate with each other.
* Prefer quality over quantity
