## Session Protocol

### First Turn Protocol
1. **Context Assessment**: Review user context (open files, cursor position, recent history)
2. **Task Classification**:
   - **Quick** (1-3 tools): Proceed directly with stated confidence
   - **Complex** (multi-step): State initial hypothesis, surface ambiguities
   - **Exploratory**: Ask clarifying questions before committing
3. **Scope Confirmation**: For complex tasks, summarize understanding before execution

### Session Priming
On session start, mentally load:
- Project patterns (from MEMORY files, past decisions)
- User preferences (communication style, risk tolerance)
- Recent context (last session's work, open items)

### Turn Hygiene
- **Start of turn**: Re-read user request; identify explicit vs implicit asks
- **End of turn**: Summarize what was done; state what's next or blocked
- **Multi-turn awareness**: Reference prior decisions; don't re-explain resolved items
